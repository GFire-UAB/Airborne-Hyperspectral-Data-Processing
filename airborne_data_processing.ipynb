    "## Standardization of RGBN and LWIR Remote Sensing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to process and standardize two different remote sensing datasets: an RGBN dataset and a LWIR (Long-Wave Infrared) dataset. The primary objective is to align both datasets in terms of spatial resolution, coordinate reference system (CRS), and value range, ensuring they can be effectively analyzed together. Unlike previous implementations, this version does not assume specific input data but maintains the same standardization process for any given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Data**  \n",
    "   - The code is structured to handle two input GeoTIFF files:  \n",
    "     - An RGBN dataset containing Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared bands.  \n",
    "     - A LWIR dataset representing long-wave infrared data.  \n",
    "   - These datasets may come from different sources and may have varying resolutions and CRS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bounding Box Intersection**  \n",
    "   - To ensure spatial consistency, the code determines the overlapping area between both datasets.  \n",
    "   - Only the intersecting region is processed, avoiding data misalignment issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reprojecting and Resampling the LWIR Dataset**  \n",
    "   - Since the RGBN and LWIR datasets might have different spatial resolutions or CRS, the LWIR dataset is reprojected and resampled to match the RGBN dataset.  \n",
    "   - This step ensures that both datasets align properly, enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel comparisons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reading and Normalizing the Data**  \n",
    "   - The spectral bands from both datasets are read as arrays.  \n",
    "   - The RGBN bands (Red, Green, and Near-Infrared) are normalized to a standard range of 0 to 1.  \n",
    "   - Similarly, the resampled LWIR data is adjusted to the same range.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating a Multi-Band GeoTIFF**  \n",
    "   - The processed bands are saved into a single multi-band GeoTIFF file.  \n",
    "   - This final output maintains the spatial alignment and standardization required for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifiable Variables for Input Data Processing  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the standardization process, three key variables must be adjusted based on the specific input data:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **RGBN_tiff**: This variable should be set to the file path of the RGBN dataset, which contains Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared bands.  \n",
    "- **thermal_tiff**: This variable should be set to the file path of the LWIR (Long-Wave Infrared) dataset.  \n",
    "- **max_band_value**: This value represents the maximum possible pixel value in the dataset. It must be determined from the particular metadata of the input data rather than assuming a fixed value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standardization Considerations  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The standardization process initially scales the data to a range between `0` and `1` using the theoretical maximum value.  \n",
    "- If a more complex standardization method is necessary to retain critical information (e.g., histogram equalization or adaptive scaling), adjustments should be made at this stage.  \n",
    "- Regardless of the chosen method, the final standardized values **must remain within the range `[0, 1]`** to ensure consistency and compatibility across datasets.  \n",
    "\n"

    "## Creating and Saving the LNV.tiff\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to generate a new raster file called **LNV.tiff**, which contains three bands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LWIR (Long-Wave Infrared)**: Represents thermal data, which is useful for detecting temperature variations in the image.\n",
    "2. **NIR (Near-Infrared)**: Captures data in the near-infrared spectrum, which is critical for vegetation analysis and identifying heat signatures.\n",
    "3. **Visible**: This is computed using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Visible} = 0.299 \\cdot \\text{Red} + 0.587 \\cdot \\text{Green} + 0.114 \\cdot \\text{Blue}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **Visible** band combines the red, green, and blue bands to create a representation of what is seen by the human eye, helping to enhance the visual context of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is LNV Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LNV.tiff** file is particularly useful for a variety of remote sensing and environmental applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fire Detection**: The combination of LWIR and NIR bands helps identify heat signatures, which are crucial for detecting fire hotspots. The **LWIR** band helps identify areas of high temperature (e.g., fire), while the **NIR** can be used to monitor the health of vegetation (fires often cause significant damage to plants).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Vegetation and Land Cover Monitoring**: The **NIR** band is highly sensitive to vegetation and is used in vegetation indices like NDVI. By combining this with the visible band, we can monitor land cover changes over time, including the impact of fires or other environmental phenomena.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Enhanced Visualization**: The **Visible** band, computed from the RGB bands, provides an intuitive representation of the data, allowing analysts to visually interpret the thermal and infrared information more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visible Index Calculation**: The visible index is calculated by combining the RGB bands using weighted values that represent the relative contributions of red, green, and blue to the visible spectrum. This helps create a realistic image representation of the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Band Stacking**: The three bands (LWIR, NIR, and Visible) are stacked together into a single multi-band raster. This makes it easier to analyze and visualize the data as a cohesive unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saving the Output**: The resulting raster, **LNV.tiff**, is saved as a GeoTIFF with the three bands. The profile of the original RGBN image is copied and updated to accommodate the new bands and ensure compatibility with GIS tools. The file is compressed using **LZW** compression to reduce file size without losing data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating and saving the **LNV.tiff**, we are preparing a valuable dataset for fire detection, environmental monitoring, and other geospatial analyses.\n"

    "## Importance of Fire Detection Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire-detection indices are critical tools used in remote sensing to identify and monitor active fires or fire-prone areas. These indices provide valuable insights into the thermal and spectral characteristics of fire-affected regions, allowing for better detection, analysis, and response to wildfire events. The indices we will compute here are particularly useful for distinguishing between fire and non-fire areas, and for assessing vegetation health and moisture content in the presence of fire. The indices we'll focus on include the **Burned Area Index (BAI)**, **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**, and **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these indices relies on specific spectral bands, typically those related to visible light, infrared, and thermal wavelengths, which are sensitive to vegetation, water content, and temperature. By calculating and analyzing these indices, we can gain a better understanding of fire behavior, the extent of fire damage, and the recovery of affected vegetation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Burned Area Index (BAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{BAI} = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\left( \\text{Red} - 0.1 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\text{NIR} - 0.06 \\right)^2 \\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "The **Burned Area Index (BAI)** is designed to highlight areas that have been burned by fire. It is a vegetation index that uses the difference between the red (visible light) and near-infrared (NIR) bands to detect changes in vegetation after a fire. Healthy vegetation typically reflects a lot of infrared light, but when it is burned, it reflects less infrared light and more visible red light. The formula calculates the inverse of the squared difference between the red and NIR bands, making it highly sensitive to burned areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{NDVI} = \\frac{\\text{NIR} - \\text{Red}}{\\text{NIR} + \\text{Red}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "The **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** is one of the most commonly used indices for vegetation monitoring. It measures the difference between the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands to assess vegetation health. Healthy vegetation has a high NDVI value, while barren or burned areas have a low or negative value. NDVI is effective for monitoring vegetation greenness and biomass, and it can indicate the extent of damage from fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{NDWI} = \\frac{\\text{Green} - \\text{NIR}}{\\text{NIR} + \\text{Green}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "The **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)** is used to monitor water content in vegetation. It uses the green and near-infrared (NIR) bands to distinguish between water and non-water surfaces. Water absorbs green light and reflects infrared light, so NDWI values are positive for water-rich areas and negative for dry areas. This index can help detect moisture changes caused by fire or drought.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Each Index Separately\n",
    "\n",
    "The indices are calculated and saved separately as individual GeoTIFF files. Each index is saved as a single-band raster to preserve the individual information for further analysis or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each index, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "1. The index is calculated based on the respective formula.\n",
    "2. A new GeoTIFF file is created for each index.\n",
    "3. The index is written to its corresponding file using the `rasterio` library.\n",
    "4. Each index is saved with compression and tiling enabled to optimize file size and compatibility with GIS tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "After saving the indices, you can visualize them using a plotting function that displays each index with appropriate color maps."

    "1. **High Percentile (e.g., 98-99%)**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Fewer, but more intense hotspots are detected. This is useful if you're interested in isolating the most significant fire activity, such as large or intense fire sources.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: This is ideal when the fire is very intense, and you're looking for the highest heat values in the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lower Percentile (e.g., 95-98%)**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: More, but less intense hotspots are detected. This is helpful for detecting broader fire activity, including smoldering areas or lower-intensity fires.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: This is useful for broader analyses where you need to identify the full extent of a fire, including areas of lesser intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:\n",
    "   - It's often helpful to visually inspect the hotspots after applying different threshold values. If the extracted hotspots seem too sparse or too dense, adjust the percentile value accordingly.\n",
    "   - For instance, if the hotspots are too numerous and you're interested in the main fire areas, try raising the threshold percentile. If you're missing smaller heat sources, lower the percentile.\n",

    "### Methodology for Raw Hotspot Extraction:\n",
    "1. **Extract Hotspots**: Using the `threshold_percentile`, we identify the pixels in the LWIR image that exceed this threshold, representing the hottest areas.\n",
    "2. **Save the Raw Hotspot Data**: We save the raw hotspot data without any filtering based on size. These hotspots are saved as geometries in a `.shp` file for further analysis."

    "## Filtering LWIR Hotspots by Area\n",
    "\n",
    "After the hotspots are identified, the next step is to filter them based on their area. This filtering is essential because not all detected hotspots are relevant; some may be noise or artifacts, especially in scenarios where smoke affects the data. To filter out such small, irrelevant hotspots, we calculate the area of each hotspot and apply a threshold. Only hotspots that have an area greater than or equal to the threshold are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Threshold Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The area threshold is calculated as a percentage of the area of the largest detected hotspot. For example, if the largest hotspot in the data has an area of 1000 pixels, and we set the threshold to 1%, the minimum acceptable area for a hotspot will be 10 pixels. Hotspots smaller than this will be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold is adjustable and must be defined by the user based on the quality of the raw hotspots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If there is a lot of smoke**: Smoke can cause isolated, small hotspots that are likely noise. In such cases, the user should set a higher threshold (like `0.5`) to remove these small, isolated hotspots. This ensures that only larger, more likely fire hotspots are kept.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **If the hotspots are clustered**: In situations where the hotspots are well-clustered and there is little smoke interference, a lower threshold (or even zero) can be used, as the small hotspots in the cluster are likely part of the same fire. In this case, there is no need to remove small hotspots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threshold_area_LWIR` is a parameter that needs to be adjusted based on how the raw hotspots appear in your data. If the raw hotspots are highly dispersed due to smoke, increase the threshold. If they are more tightly clustered, decrease the threshold, or set it to zero to retain even the smallest hotspots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",

    "> \"All fires detected using LWIR are too small\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the `threshold_area_LWIR` is too high, and you will need to lower it to retain valid hotspots. This can happen especially if the raw hotspots were very small or if the fire is dispersed, resulting in many small hotspots that are still relevant.\n"

    "1. **Focus on Burned Area Extension**: Unlike LWIR, which identifies heat sources or hotspots related to active fire, **BAI identifies the extent of burned areas**.

A higher threshold will help ensure that only larger, more contiguous burned areas are retained, reducing the impact of smoke on the data.\n",

The **threshold for filtering** should therefore be adjusted based on the level of smoke interference.

    "## Combining BAI Burned Areas and LWIR Hotspots to Determine Fire Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the **current extension of a fire** at a specific timestamp, it's essential to combine both **BAI Burned areas** and **LWIR hotspots**. Each dataset provides different but complementary insights into the fire's behavior, allowing for a more accurate understanding of its spatial spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BAI Burned Areas**: The BAI index indicates areas that have already burned. It represents the **fire's footprint**, showing the extent of the area affected by fire. This is crucial for understanding the overall area of destruction, even if the fire is no longer actively burning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LWIR Hotspots**: On the other hand, LWIR hotspots capture areas with high thermal signatures, often associated with ongoing fire activity. These hotspots can indicate **active fire** and help identify the regions where the fire is currently spreading or intensifying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Combine Both Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these two datasets is important for creating a comprehensive view of the fire's **spatial extension**. By merging BAI burned areas with LWIR hotspots, we can achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capturing Ongoing and Past Fire Activity**: BAI shows where fire has already occurred, while LWIR hotspots identify where the fire is still active. By combining both, we capture the **total fire extension**, both in terms of already burned areas and areas with ongoing heat sources. This is especially useful for monitoring fire progression over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **More Accurate Fire Mapping**: Relying on only one of these datasets could lead to incomplete or misleading maps. For example, using only BAI might ignore the ongoing spread of the fire, while using only hotspots might miss areas that have already been burned but still have residual heat. The combination of both gives a clearer and more accurate picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved Fire Management and Response**: For fire management, understanding the current and past extension of the fire is critical for resource allocation and decision-making. By combining BAI and LWIR hotspots, we can more effectively monitor fire dynamics and prioritize areas for intervention."

A ratio of `0.3` is typically used, as it slightly overestimates the area, which is generally preferred in fire monitoring to ensure safety and a more cautious approach. However, you can adjust this ratio depending on the level of precision you need:\n",
    "- **Lower ratio (e.g., 0.1)**: Results in a more detailed shape with tighter curves, fitting closely to the actual data points.\n",
    "- **Higher ratio (e.g., 0.5)**: Produces a more relaxed shape that is less tightly fitted to the points, potentially overestimating the fire's boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Considerations:\n",
    "- **Too Low of a Ratio**: If the ratio is too low, the concave hull may form multiple disconnected fragments instead of a continuous shape. This happens because the shape tries to fit each point very closely, which can lead to undesirable gaps.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Too High of a Ratio**: If the ratio is too high, the concave hull will become too inflated, covering a larger area than necessary. This could lead to overestimating the fire's true extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting the ratio appropriately, you can generate a more reliable and meaningful representation of the fire's current extension."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately estimate the extension of a fire, it is essential to combine multiple data sources, such as BAI burned areas and LWIR hotspots, along with other relevant products. Each of these datasets provides different insights into the fire's behavior, and their integration allows for a more comprehensive and precise assessment of the fire's current and past extent. Relying on a single source could lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions, making the combination of these products a crucial step in fire monitoring and analysis.\n"
